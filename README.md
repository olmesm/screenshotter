# Screenshotter

Simple tool that captures a screenshot of a desired URL via a commandline. Useful for visual regression or showcasing a change in flow.

Note this was built as a single use and therefore specific use tool. It will be refactored for more general purposes if used again, however the structure and automation exists.
